# Declarative environment hints for Goalie panels and federation tools.
#
# This lets you map structured pattern fields like `framework` and `scheduler`
# to higher-level environment hints used by VSCode micro-copy and retro prompts.
#
# Example pattern event payloads (from .goalie/pattern_metrics.jsonl):
#   {"pattern": "ml-training-guardrail", "framework": "tf", ...}
#   {"pattern": "hpc-batch-window", "scheduler": "slurm", ...}
#
# Both `framework` and `scheduler` keys are optional. Unknown values are ignored.
# Regex-based inference from host/tags remains as a fallback for older logs.
