# DT model quality thresholds for PRODUCTION environments.
#
# Rationale:
# - Gate deployment of DT policies on stable, high-quality behavior.
# - Targets are stricter than staging and may be tightened further as
#   maturity improves.
# - Use these for real production prod-cycle runs via:
#     ./scripts/af validate-success --env production
#
model_quality_thresholds:
  # Global minimum acceptable top-1 accuracy over action_id.
  # Production requires reliably correct actions for the majority of steps.
  min_top1_accuracy: 0.70

  # Maximum acceptable mean absolute error over continuous action parameters.
  # These should be well-calibrated for budgets, depths, etc.
  max_cont_mae: 0.15

  # Per-circle minimum top-1 accuracy for critical governance circles.
  # These are aligned with the defaults in dt_validation_thresholds.yaml
  # but split into an explicit production profile.
  per_circle_min_top1_orchestrator: 0.70
  per_circle_min_top1_assessor: 0.70
