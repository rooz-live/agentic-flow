# DT model quality thresholds for STAGING / DEVELOPMENT environments.
#
# Rationale:
# - Allow experimentation and frequent retraining.
# - Ensure the model is not completely broken, but do not block deployments
#   on aggressive targets while patterns and rewards are still evolving.
# - Use these for non-production prod-cycle runs via:
#     ./scripts/af validate-success --env staging
#
model_quality_thresholds:
  # Global minimum acceptable top-1 accuracy over action_id.
  # Staging is lenient: just require the model to be better than random.
  min_top1_accuracy: 0.40

  # Maximum acceptable mean absolute error over continuous action parameters.
  # Staging is permissive to allow exploration of new parameterizations.
  max_cont_mae: 0.50

  # Per-circle minimum top-1 accuracy for key circles.
  # Staging thresholds are intentionally lower than production.
  per_circle_min_top1_orchestrator: 0.35
  per_circle_min_top1_assessor: 0.35
